As part of the Microsoft AI for Good Research Lab, I work on applying AI to solve problems in the fields of sustainability, energy and health care. My research interests lie at the intersection of science and machine learning, including materials informatics, computational biology, physics-informed machine learning and Bayesian optimization. I am very excited about the opportunities provided by modern machine learning to accelerate science and engineering.

Prior to joining Microsoft, I completed my PhD at MIT under the guidance of Prof. Tonio Buonassisi (MIT MechE) and Dr. John Fisher (MIT CSAIL). My dissertation title was “Accelerated development of photovoltaics by physics-informed machine learning”. I developed and deployed machine learning algorithms to accelerate the experimental screening, development and optimization of renewable energy materials and technologies. I collaborated broadly with researchers in the US (Stanford, AFRL), Singapore (SMART, NUS) and Germany (FAU). My work obtained the best paper award in the NeurIPS Climate Change AI workshop 2019 and the MIT Ideas Global Challenge Prize 2017. As a side project, I developed and deployed education software for remote communities in the Ecuadorian Amazon.

In a past life, I briefly worked in the energy industry and completed an internship on particle detector design at CERN .

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
